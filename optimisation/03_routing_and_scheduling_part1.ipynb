    "Many healthcare systems manage assets or workforces that they need to deploy geographically. One example, is a community nursing team. These are teams of highly skilled nurses that must visit patients in their own home. Another example, is patient transport services where a fleet of non-emergency ambulances pick up patients from their own home and transport them to outpatient appointments in a clinical setting. These problems are highly complex. For example, in the community nursing example, patients will have a variety of conditions, treatments may be time dependent (for example, insulin injections), nurses will have mixed skills and staffing will vary over time.\n",

One of the key benefits of hill climbers is that they are relatively fast (because they are simple).  You can even set a time limit to get some of the benefit of local search without greatly extending the execution time of your algorithm.\n",
